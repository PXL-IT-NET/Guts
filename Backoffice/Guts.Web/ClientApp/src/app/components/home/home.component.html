<h1>GUTS</h1>
<p>
  The GUTS <em>(Growing towards a Unit Testing strategy)</em> application is a tool for teachers and students to support courses that have team projects and/or programming exercises.
</p>
<p>
  GUTS enables students to immediately get feedback on the progress of programming exercises or projects by running automated tests.<br />
  The test results of automated tests can be sent to the GUTS api that collects and stores the results.
  Students and teachers can monitor the progress of the exercises and projects.
</p>
<p>
  GUTS also supports peer assessment for teams in a project. Students can evaluate the contribution, effort and cooperation of their team members.
